#  Jackson's Programming Portfolio

### This is a running collection of the projects in which I have deemed noteworthy 

1. Simulated stargazing environment
- worked with a partner to build an Object oriented environment that simulated our solar system
- I handled the object work while he mainly assisted with the data science side of it (checking time conditions, conversions, array management) (collaborator named Sam Davies)

2. Tutoring website
- in my own time, i tutor C++ programming to kids. I wanted to use what I was learning in CSS and HTML to build a landing site for this. This is also imbedded.

3. Shopping list generator
- using python I made a shopping list for personal use. It takes user input to either run through
a whole list, or add a particular item
